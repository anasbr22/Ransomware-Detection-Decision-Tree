# Ransomware Detection with a Decision Tree

This project uses a decision tree to classify ransomware malware. It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization steps.

## Project Structure

- **data**: contains the `ransomware_dataset.csv` file for training and testing.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: Data manipulation.
- `numpy`: Scientific calculations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine Learning models.
- `mlxtend`: Confusion matrix plotting.
- `joblib`: Model saving.
